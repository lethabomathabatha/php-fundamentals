    <!-- Start PHP code -->
    <?php
        // Arithmetic operators: +,-,*,/,%
        // Assignment operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, .=
        // Comparison operators: ==, ===, !=, !==, >, <, >=, <=

        /* Comparison operator - spaceship: <=>. This operator is only available in PHP 7.1 and above
            If the value of the left operand is less than the value of the right operand, the spaceship operator returns -1
            If the value of the left operand is greater than the value of the right operand, the spaceship operator returns 1
            If the value of the left operand is equal to the value of the right operand, the spaceship operator returns 0
            
            e.g: $5 <=> $7 returns -1 if $5 is less than $7, 0 if $5 is equal to $7, and 1 if $5 is greater than $7. 
            In this case, $5 is less than $7 and therefore the spaceship operator returns -1

        // Increment and decrement operators: ++$x, --$x, $x++, $x--
